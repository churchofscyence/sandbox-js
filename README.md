## Section 1: Setup


### Setup JavaScript with Node.js

Creating directory and change directories of the work space. From the Command Line Terminal run the following commands.
```
% mkdir section1
% cd section1 
```

Create the package.json to manage your changes libaries. The y option will automatically accept all defaults.
```
% npm init -y
```

Create source directory.
```
% mkdir src
% cd src
% touch copy-object.js
```

Change following configuration in the package.json file
```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./src/copy-object.js"
  },
```

Run the project
```
% npm run start
```

# Section2: Objects

### Copy Objects
1. **Object.assign()** You use this method to copy the values and properties from one or 
more source objects to a target object.
```
// Declaring Object
const userDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 14,
  verified: false
};

// Cloning the Object with Object.assign() Method
let cloneUser = Object.assign({}, userDetails);

console.log(cloneUser); // {name: 'John Doe', age: 14, verified: false}
```
2. **JSON.parse()** You will use this method alongside JSON.stringify(). You can use this to deeply 
clone.
```
// Declaring Object
const userDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 14,
  verified: false
};

// Cloning the Object with JSON.parse() Method
let cloneUser = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(userDetails));

console.log(cloneUser); // {name: 'John Doe', age: 14, verified: false}
```
3. **For Loop** You can iterate through objects and copy the contents from one object to another with the a For Loop.
```
const userDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 14,
  verified: false
};

let clone = {};

for (let key in userDetails) {
    clone[key] = userDetails[key];
}

console.log(clone.name);
```

# Section 3 : Call Back

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. 
The function that receives the callback can then call our code when it finishes a long task,
while allowing us to continue the execution of the code.

# Section 4 : Promise    
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you 
to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets
asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value,
the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

A Promise is in one of these states:

* pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
* fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
* rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

The eventual state of a pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error).
When either of these options occur, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called.
If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler 
will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers 
being attached.

A promise is said to be settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.


# Section 5 : Generate

Generators are a special kind of function in JavaScript that allow you to define a custom iterator. 
They are created using the function* syntax and can be paused and resumed at any point during their 
execution using the yield keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, 
which is also an iterator.
